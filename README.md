# PayrollProcessingSystemGUI

This projects simulates a payroll processing system for a company's employee database.
In addition to calculating the payment for each employee, the Graphical User Interface also supports exporting and importing employee databases.
It also allows users to add/remove employees, and manually input employee information or set part time employee hours.
I have included a database.txt file to use in order to test the project's importing capabilities.
